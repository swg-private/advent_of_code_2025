# Advent of Code 2025

## Solutions

Solutions for the following days exist in the following languages:

| Day | Task 1 | Task 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Haskell | - |

## How do I run the solutions?

### Haskell

Run `cabal build` to compile the given day and `cabal run` to run it from within the folder for the day.

Sometimes there is a test suite that can be run with `cabal test`.

### Perl

Run `perl <script_name>.pl` from within the day's folder. Any more or less recent version will suffice.
